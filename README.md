# Manhattan K-Clustering Model
This model groups Manhattan latitude and longitude data points into clusters based upon the most common nearby business venue types. Using this Model, we can identify neighborhoods with similar characteristics. Refer to the [Manhattan K-Clustering Model](https://github.com/derekvogt3/Manhattan-K-Clustering-Model/blob/master/Manhattan%20K-Clustering%20Model%20-%20WeWork.ipynb) for more detail on the model.
